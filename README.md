# EmoDetectionPreprocessing

## Installation

I recommend ``git lfs`` while cloning the repo, as it contains many videos (it might also work without `lfs`)

```sh
git lfs clone https://github.com/AdmiralLuke/EmoDetectionPreprocessing
```

For all dependencies, you can use ``venv`` or generally ``pip`` (and alternatives)

```sh
pip install -r  requirements.txt
```

To start the training simply run

```sh
python video_transformer.py
```

I recommend a lot of computation power :). You can also use the convolution based ``video_model.py``.
